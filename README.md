This tool can download an artist's gallery on fantia.

## Status
It works. But it's rough around the edges. Keep that in mind.

## Dependencies
I developed it with PHP 7.2, but it should work with PHP 5.x versions aswell.
It needs the cURL extension, that should be it.

## Key
You will need to supply a key as an argument.
The key is the value of the _session_id cookie in your browser when you are logged into the site.
You can find it using various methods, likely most accessible to you is your browser's developer console.
